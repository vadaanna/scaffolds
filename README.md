This code is used to analyse mass spec data from 45 samples 
This is useful to sort a list for different criterias


Synopsis

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

The project exist because we have alot of data from mass spec, that we need to sort and cluster into different groups.

Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
Install code by downloading from Github. Copy URL, and import in Spyder.

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

Contributors
